# CS303---Project-1B
 
 Main Idea: Create a priority queue that will allow the circulation of books to employees.
 
 The priority queue is based off of how long each employee waits for a book. Books can be
 checked out, passed on, and archived. The priority queue is composed of Employee nodes.
 These nodes store the information for waiting time and retaining time.
